.SH NAME
mouseemu \- Emulate mouse buttons and mouse wheel

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mouseemu 
.RI [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B Mouseemu
is a daemon to emulate mouse buttons on trackpads with only 
one button. 
It lets you:
.br
  - emulate middle and right click
.br
  - emulate mouse wheel
.br
  - block trackpad while typing
.PP
It was initially developed for Apple PowerBooks
and iBooks, but it may be useful on other architectures
as well. 
.PP
This program only works when booting a 2.6 kernel because
it uses the new uinput interface to emulate the mouse.
.PP

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -middle B2_MOD B2_KEY
Modifier and key for the middle (second) mouse button. Defaults to F10 and no modifier
on PowerPC and Intel Macs, and to none on all other architectures.
.TP
.B -right B3_MOD B3_KEY
Modifier and key for the right (third) mouse button. Defaults to F11 and no modifier
on PowerPC and Intel Macs, and to none on all other architectures.
.TP
.B -scroll SCROLL_MOD
Modifier for the scrolling function. Defaults to Alt.
.TP
.B -typing-block DELAY
Time in milliseconds for which the trackpad will be blocked while typing on the keyboard.
Defaults to 300ms.
.TP
.B -device UINPUT
Device node for the uinput device. Defaults to /dev/uinput. If this device is not read and 
writeable the following devices are also tried: /dev/uinput, /dev/input/uinput and 
/dev/misc/uinput.
.TP
.B -nofork
don't run in the background
.TP
.B -help

.PP
The key codes for the buttons and modifiers are key scancodes. They can be found in 
include/linux/input.h in the kernel headers or by using `showkey` in a console. The 
keycodes must be given as decimal values (`showkey` displays hex values!).

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To have the same behaviour as in MacOS X (CTRL-click for right mouse button and no
emulation for the middle button):
.PP
.RS 4
.B mouseemu -middle 0 0 -right 29 272
.RE
.PP
The code for the (left) mouse button is 272 (0x110 in hex). The code for CTRL is 29.
