0) specify the default keys you want in defkeys.h
1) run `make`
2) as root run `make install`
3) as root run `mouseemu` (`mouseemu -help`)

This mouse button emulation tool lets you 
- emulate middle and right click
- emulate wheel
- block trackpad while typing

This is done in userland, and requires a 2.6 kernel with uinput support.
Parameters are specifiable via command-line.

Scroll problems ? mouse Protocol in XF86Config should be set to ExplorerPS/2.
