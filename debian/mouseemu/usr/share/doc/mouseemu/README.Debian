Mouseemu uses uinput which is accessible through 
/dev/input/uinput. If you don't already have this
device and are not using either udev or devfs you
have to create this device node by calling

cd /dev ; ./MAKEDEV uinput

The postinst script should create the device node
for you upon the first installation of mouseemu. So
this is only necessary in unusual situations or if 
you manually delete the device node.
